Context Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All information in this data file has been randomly rounded to base 3, data found here is rounded independently from other products produced by MSD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From 12 February 2021, MSD started applying a range of new confidentiality procedures to social data releases. These procedures will continue to protect client information,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while making more data available. To find out how we have changed the way we work with client information visit:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/tools/how-we-keep-data-private.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a limited number of circumstances, low numbers may potentially lead to individuals being identified, regardless of random rounding. Due to these privacy concerns,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
numbers for some groups of people may be suppressed or aggregated. Secondary suppression rules have also been applied when required. Suppressed numbers have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been replaced by an 'S'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Housing Register provides the number of applicants assessed as eligible for social housing who are ready to be matched to a suitable property.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"People who already live in social housing, but have applied and are eligible to transfer to another property are placed on the Transfer Register.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Register exits for other reasons includes historical C and D priority applications who have exited because their priority has decreased.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The number of bedrooms the applicant is requiring based on the assessment of their housing application includes the needs of the people that will be living in the same house as the applicant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From December 2021, we have introduced a new reporting approach called 'total response'. Making this change means we recognise all aspects of someone's ethnicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and allows us to represent the full diversity of communities, whānau, and people in Aotearoa. This reflects our clients more accurately, aligns our approach with",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Statistics NZ's reporting, and reflects best practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The total response ethnicity percentages are calculated by dividing the number of people who identify with each ethnic group by the total unique number of people with a reported ethnicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(this excludes people who have not specified an ethnicity). Total response ethnicity means people can appear more than once in our reporting, so ethnic group totals will add to more than 100 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ethnicity is about people's identity and sense of belonging. Ethnicity measures cultural affiliation, rather than race, ancestry, nationality, or citizenship. Ethnicity is self-perceived and people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can identify with more than one ethnic group. Previously, we reported ethnicity using an approach called 'prioritised ethnicity'. Prioritised ethnicity meant that we allocated people to a single ethnic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"group in an order of priority. The priority previously used by MSD was Māori, Pacific Peoples, Other, and NZ European. For more information please see:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/tools/how-we-report-ethnicity.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information on the SAS criteria used to determine eligibility and priority can be found at:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/social-housing/assessmentof-eligibility/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Priority A refers to applicants who are considered at risk and includes households with a severe and persistent housing need that must be addressed immediately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Priority B refers to applicants who have a serious housing need and includes households with a significant and persistent need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
