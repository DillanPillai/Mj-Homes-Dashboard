Context Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All information in this data file has been randomly rounded to base 3, data found here is rounded independently from other products produced by MSD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From 12 February 2021, MSD started applying a range of new confidentiality procedures to public data releases. These procedures will continue to protect client information,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while making more data available. To find out how we have changed the way we work with client information visit:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/tools/how-we-keep-data-private.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a limited number of circumstances, low numbers may potentially lead to individuals being identified, regardless of random rounding. Due to these privacy concerns,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
numbers for some groups of people may be suppressed or aggregated. Secondary suppression rules have also been applied when required. Suppressed numbers have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been replaced by an 'S',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emergency Housing assistance payments are granted as Emergency Housing Grants (EHGs). A client can have more than one grant in the time period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The total amount granted for an EHG may not be the same as the amount spent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This consecutive weeks calculation is based on the clients most recent grant within a month. They may have had multiple grants in a month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A clients total stay may cross more than one quarter. The length of stay at the time of their last grant in each month is what is used to calculate the average.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consecutive weeks in Emergency Housing are calculated based on the check in and check out dates for which EHGs have been granted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The consecutive weeks calculation is operational and as such can change slightly over time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One registered supplier may provide accommodation across multiple premises. These premises may be in different locations or operating trading names,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but are receiving payment through a single supplier record.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MSD region is based on the Work and Income region where the recommending case manager for the application was based at the time of the grant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This may differ to the client's residential address or the location of the EH supplier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Household composition is based on the declared adults and children staying in Emergency Housing at the end of the month and may not be reflective,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of their actual family size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Details of the individual children attached to each EHG are not recorded and as such we are unable to count the number of unique children in Emergency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Housing across a period if their caregivers have had more than one grant in the period.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From December 2021, we have introduced a new reporting approach called 'total response'. Making this change means we recognise all aspects of someone's ethnicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and allows us to represent the full diversity of communities, whānau, and people in Aotearoa. This reflects our clients more accurately, aligns our approach with",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Statistics NZ's reporting, and reflects best practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The total response ethnicity percentages are calculated by dividing the number of people who identify with each ethnic group by the total unique number of people with a reported ethnicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(this excludes people who have not specified an ethnicity). Total response ethnicity means people can appear more than once in our reporting, so ethnic group totals will add to more than 100 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of people receiving an EHG each month has not changed, but the way we represent them has.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ethnicity is about people's identity and sense of belonging. Ethnicity measures cultural affiliation, rather than race, ancestry, nationality, or citizenship. Ethnicity is self-perceived and people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can identify with more than one ethnic group. Previously, we reported ethnicity using an approach called 'prioritised ethnicity'. Prioritised ethnicity meant that we allocated people to a single ethnic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"group in an order of priority. The priority previously used by MSD was Māori, Pacific Peoples, Other, and NZ European. For more information please see:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/tools/how-we-report-ethnicity.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Age of primary recipient is taken at the last grant in the month. It may not reflect the clients age throughout the month.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
